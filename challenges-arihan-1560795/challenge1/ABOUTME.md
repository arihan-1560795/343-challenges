<p>I'm hoping to learn all about web development and form the skills to ace building both front and back end web systems through INFO 343 and INFO 344 which I will be taking next quarter. That, and I think IFNO 343 will teach me a lot; I'm excited to explore the breadth of what this class has to offer from building websites and collaborating with teammates using GitHub, to using new technology like React by Facebook for exciting user experiences!</p>
